I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Zhejiang University's DCD Lab, jointly advised by Prof. [Yang Yang](http://yangy.org/) and Prof. [Jiarong Xu](https://galina0217.github.io/#). 

Additionally, I also collaborate with Prof. [Carl Yang](https://www.cs.emory.edu/~jyang71/). Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Zhejiang University. Besides, I also have been the visiting student to Fudan University and National University of Singapore.

My research primarily focuses on graph machine learning (specifically graph transfer learning and graph adversarial learning) and large language models (LLMs).
My current work explores two key directions: (1) developing multi-agent systems for social simulation, and (2) designing efficient preference-based alignment methods for LLMs.
